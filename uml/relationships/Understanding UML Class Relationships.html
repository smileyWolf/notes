<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Some time ago 
while interviewing dozens of prospective developers for a project, I 
discovered that around 90% of candidates claiming to know UML very well 
could not distinguish between some of the common UML relationship 
elements used in class diagrams:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/allrelationships.gif" alt="allrelationships" width="294" height="390"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Can you name 
each of the above relationships using UML nomenclature? Can you describe
 what each of the relationships mean relative to your target programming
 language, such as Java?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">UML is not 
just about pretty pictures. If used correctly, UML precisely conveys how
 code should be implemented from diagrams. If precisely interpreted, the
 implemented code will correctly reflect the intent of the designer. You
 may say, “it doesn’t matter that much because I know what I mean and I 
know how to implement it.” True, in a project where the architect, the 
analyst, the designer, and the developer roles are all filled by one 
person (e.g. you), having a disconnect between diagram and 
implementation sort of works out — at least until someone else gets 
involved. Nonetheless, that’s a small-project mentality, not to mention 
the fact that it’s a near-sighted approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">What about 
large organizations where huge systems and applications are developed? 
When different people or even different teams of people fill the above 
roles, all the people involved better understand what each of the UML 
relationships drawn on class diagrams represent. Otherwise, the 
misrepresentation and/or misinterpretation of the UML will result in 
incorrect implementations of code. With tight project timelines there’s 
no time for unnecessary re-implementation. This article is meant to help
 you and your team to interpret UML class relationships correctly the 
first time. So, let’s dig in!</span></p>
<h2>Dependency</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The UML <em>dependency</em>
 relationship is the least formal of them all. It means that the class 
at the source end of the relationship has some sort of dependency on the
 class at the target (arrowhead) end of the relationship. For example, 
the following simple states that class A depends on class B in some way:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/dependency.gif" alt="dependency" width="292" height="90"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">While 
dependency may have broad meaning, it is best not to overuse the 
dependency relationship. In an analysis model class diagram such as a 
domain model diagram you may be tempted to convey that all the classes 
just depend on each other. Interestingly however, the <em>Rational Unified Process</em> (RUP) specifies that the general class relationship that should be used in the analysis model is <em>association</em>
 (covered next), and not dependency. Therefore, even when you are 
modeling higher-level concepts it is best not to use the dependency 
relationship loosely. It is just too nebulous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Further, 
unless you use the dependency relationship in a constrained manner your 
model consumers (yourself or other developers) will simply have too 
broad an interpretation of its meaning. Generally those filling 
architect and designer roles in a project are there to give guidance to 
less experienced developers. Thus the dependency relationship should be 
used to convey a specific kind of guidance from architects and designers
 to developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So what should
 a dependency relationship represent? In our UML example above the 
dependency means that class A uses class B, but that class A does not 
contain an instance of class B as part of its own state. It also means 
that if class B’s interface changes it will likely impact class A and 
require it to change. I suggest that you constrain your use of 
dependency relationships to non-state related concerns. You would use 
dependency to indicate that, for example, class A receives an instance 
of class B as a parameter to at least one of its methods. You would also
 use dependency to indicate that class A creates an instance of class B 
local to one of its methods (on the stack). You would not, however, use 
dependency to indicate that class A declares an instance variable of 
class B, as that would indicate a state-related concern. Again, use <em>association</em> to do that (covered next).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In Java, the following is the proper interpretation of the constrained dependency relationship:</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">import B; public class A { public void method1(B b) { // . . . } </span><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">public void method2() { B tempB = new B(); // . . . } } </span></pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Actually 
either one of class B’s uses, as a parameter to a method, or as a local 
instance reference inside a method, would be appropriate reflection of a
 UML dependency relationship. Basically to Java the constrained 
dependency relationship means that you must import class B into class A 
so that class A may reference it in some way in a method. However, the 
following would be an incorrect implementation of the constrained 
dependency relationship in Java:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>import B;

public class A {

  private B b; // wrong!

  public B getB() {
    return b;
  }
}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In the above 
example class B is used to define the state of an instance of class A by
 declaring an instance of class B with the instance scope. However, this
 is a misinterpretation of the dependency relationship. But that does 
lead us to the use of the next UML class relationship type, <em>association</em>.</span></p>
<h2>Association</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now that the 
dependency relationship is understood-that is, we know what dependency 
means and what it does not mean-it is easier to understand the UML class
 relationship called <em>association</em>. Here’s an example of one class that has an association with another class:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/association.gif" alt="association" width="294" height="90"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Association defines dependency, but a much stronger dependency than that described above with the plain <em>dependency</em>
 relationship. The arrowhead means that there is a one-way relationship.
 In this example it means that class A1 is associated with class B1. In 
other words, class A1 uses and contains one instance of class B1, but B1
 does not know about or contain any instances of class A1. This example 
manifests itself as the following Java code:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>import B1;
public class A1 {
  private B1 b1;
  public B1 getB1() {
    return b1;
  }
}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So, in a sense
 the association relationship specifies what the constrained dependency 
relationship does not. The association relationship does define the 
state of instances of the dependent class. The dependent class (A1) 
must, therefore, define an instance of the associated class (B1) within 
its class scope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There’s more 
to the association relationship. Because we are now discussing state, it
 may be necessary to define the lifetime of the instances that make up 
the dependent object’s state, and how many of the associated class 
instances there are. These modeling techniques refer to 
aggregation/composition and multiplicity, respectively. For example, the
 following shows an aggregation association between two classes:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/aggregation.gif" alt="aggregation" width="310" height="100"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A clear 
diamond adornment has been added to the source side of the relationship.
 This means that A1 aggregates a B1. Aggregation describes an 
association where an instance of A1 contains a reference to an instance 
of B1 as part of the A1’s state, but the use of the specific instance of
 B1 is or may be shared among other aggregators. A shared association 
means that the lifetime of the aggregated object, the instance of B1 in 
this case, is outside the scope of the referencing object. Therefore, 
when a specific instance of A1 goes out of scope (e.g. garbage 
collected), the instance of B1 does not (of necessity) go out of scope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Composition on
 the other hand defines a relationship where the scope of the containing
 object (an A1) and the contained object (a B1) is related. When the 
containing object goes out of scope, then the contained object also goes
 out of scope. The composition adornment looks like the aggregation 
adornment, except the composition adornment is darkened:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/composition.gif" alt="composition" width="310" height="100"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The numeric 
adornments next to the association arrow indicate the number of 
instances involved in the association. This example says that one 
instance of class A1 will always contain (state) references to many 
instances of class B1. There is a range of available multiplicity 
adornments that can be used, for example 0, 1, 0..1, 0..*, 1..3, 1..*, 
and so forth. Multiplicity may also be used when an association 
relationship shows aggregation or composition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A guideline on
 the modeling of multiplicity is appropriate. In the above example the 
diagram states that one instance of A1 contains many instances of B1. 
This implies an array association. However, in your target programming 
language you may not want to implement this relationship as a literal 
array of B1 instances:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>import B1;
public class A1 {
  private B1[] b1;
  // . . .
  public B1 getB1(int anIndex) {

    return b1[anIndex];
  }
}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As you have 
probably experienced, dealing with an array in this way is complicated. 
You must reallocate the array each time a new item is added to it and 
you must check index ranges before accessing it. Clearly the method 
getB1(…) above is not well written, as an unhandled runtime exception is
 almost guaranteed at some point in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In Java you 
would likely decide to use some form of java.util.Collection, such as 
java.lang.List as implemented by java.lang.ArrayList rather than a 
literal array. An organizational standard should be authored that states
 how such associations should be modeled in UML. Certainly in an 
analysis model the above multiplicity association is appropriate. It 
clearly shows the intent of the relationship. But I suggest that in the 
design model such relationships will be clearer to developers who will 
be interpreting diagrams if you use the following standard:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/associationrole.gif" alt="associationrole" width="310" height="100"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Rather than 
using multiplicity in the design model, unless you absolutely intend for
 an array to be used, I believe the above to be a better use of UML. 
This association relationship states that one instance of A1 will 
declare an instance variable of class java.util.List and that the 
instance variable’s name will be b1List, which is expressed as a UML 
role name. Here’s a snippet of the corresponding code:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List;</span>

import B1;

public class A1 {

  private List b1List;

  public A1() {

    super();

    b1List = new ArrayList();
  }

  // . . .
}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Many of the 
concerns we have with using Java arrays have disappeared because of the 
use of a pre-written and well-tested class. And besides, the UML 
perfectly communicates the designer’s intent to the programmer who will 
be interpreting the diagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There may be 
an exception to the above rule-of-thumb. If your UML tool allows you to 
specify an overriding collection class for various multiplicity types 
(e.g. ordered and qualified) you may determine that the use of 
multiplicity is justified. The code that the tool generates per your 
overriding collection class specifications will clearly indicate the 
architect’s or designer’s intent.</span></p>
<h2>Generalization</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">UML 
generalization is one of the better-understood relationships, and 
symbolizes what is known as inheritance in the world of object-oriented 
programming. It is sometimes also called specialization because the 
subclass is a specialization of the more generic super class:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/generalization.gif" alt="generalization" width="290" height="90"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">More 
specifically UML generalization corresponds to class extension in the 
Java language. The above diagram fragment would be implemented in Java 
as follows:</span></p>
<pre><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">import B2;</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,mono;">public class A2 extends B2 { // . . . }</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">B2 is the 
super class and A2 is the subclass in the relationship. Just remember 
that the generalization symbol forms a line from the subclass to its 
super class with the clear triangular arrowhead pointing at the super 
class.</span></p>
<h2>Realization</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The
 final UML class relationship type I cover is realization. This 
relationship is somewhat related to generalization, but a bit different.
 In object-oriented programming parlance realization represents the 
implementation of an interface by a class. So it represents how some 
characteristics of a class are defined, but says nothing about the 
implementation details:</span></p>
<p><img src="Understanding%20UML%20Class%20Relationships_files/realization.gif" alt="realization" width="291" height="90"></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This diagram 
fragment states that class A3 implements or realizes the interface 
defined by B3. In the Java language the above realization relationship 
would be programmed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>import B3;

public class A3 implements B3 {
  // . . .
}</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Realization is
 very important when designing object-oriented subsystems and 
frameworks. The interface being realized in a class diagram represents a
 contract between the subsystem or framework and its consumer. The 
interface publisher guarantees that any consumer implementing one or 
more of its public interfaces properly will have some level of 
consistent integration with the interface-defining subsystem or 
framework.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As I stated at
 the outset, UML can play a much greater role than drawing pictures. UML
 has the properties necessary to provide tremendous value in conveying 
how a software architecture and design should be implemented. If all 
technical project stakeholders understand the four UML relationship 
types used in class diagrams as discussed in this article, you can be 
certain that the quality of your UML modeling and of your 
implementations will increase.</span></p>

There’s more to the association relationship. Because we are now discussing state, it may be necessary to define the lifetime of the instances that make up the dependent object’s state, and how many of the associated class instances there are. These modeling techniques refer to aggregation/composition and multiplicity, respectively.

Figure: aggregation

A clear diamond adornment has been added to the source side of the relationship. This means that A1 aggregates a B1. Aggregation describes an association where an instance of A1 contains a reference to an instance of B1 as part of the A1’s state, but the use of the specific instance of B1 is or may be shared among other aggregators. A shared association means that the lifetime of the aggregated object, the instance of B1 in this case, is outside the scope of the referencing object. Therefore, when a specific instance of A1 goes out of scope (e.g. garbage collected), the instance of B1 does not (of necessity) go out of scope.

UML generalization is one of the better-understood relationships, and symbolizes what is known as inheritance in the world of object-oriented programming. It is sometimes also called specialization because the subclass is a specialization of the more generic super class:

More specifically UML generalization corresponds to class extension in the Java language. The above diagram fragment would be implemented in Java as follows:

import B2;

public class A2 extends B2 { // . . . }

B2 is the super class and A2 is the subclass in the relationship. Just remember that the generalization symbol forms a line from the subclass to its super class with the clear triangular arrowhead pointing at the super class.

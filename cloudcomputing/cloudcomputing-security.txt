=> Security Concerns

   + cloud computing frees both individuals and organizations from the cost and hassle of installing, maintaining and constantly upgrading software applications 
     on their desktops and in their data centres

   + also allows companies to focus on their core competencies, rather than investing in centralized computing facilities that have to be maintained 
     and upgraded and that may not be utilized at an optimum capacity

   + critics of cloud computing point to the fact that

     - users become totally reliant on a high quality Internet connection

     - Cloud computing also creates a reliance on external suppliers which may also raise potential business continuity, data protection and security risks

       Ex: anybody or any company that makes web searches or sends e-mail -- let alone who makes online purchases or does 
           their banking online -- is already trusting both the quality of available online security, as well as the security of those they purchase from, 
           not to mention the integrity of their Internet Service Provider

       Ex: a reliable Internet connection has now become as requisite a utility service for business and personal activities 
           as a constantly available phone network and electricity supply

   + as is usually the case when problems occur -- security was compromised at the user and not the vendor end of the cloud computing chain

     - anybody using cloud computing services needs to take appropriate measures for ensuring safe web access. These include setting a strong password, 
       ensuring antivirus, antispyware and firewall software are installed, and ensuring that their operating system and web browser(s) are 
       always updated with the latest security patches. All users also need to be educated not to open suspicious e-mails that may contain and install malware.

     - Google's recently released Chrome OS operating system relies entirely on Google Docs and other cloud based applications and storage. 
       In turn, as Google advertise, this will make Chrome-based computers far more secure as it is simply not be possible for applications to be locally installed. 
       For years we have heralded computers as programmable devices on which we can install local software

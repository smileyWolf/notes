=> private cloud (or more fully a vendor managed private cloud

   + customer rents a number of co-located servers in part of a data centre

     - cloud hardware is as separate as possible from that of other users

     - most secure form of IaaS

     - cannot be dynamically scaled

     - is the most expensive form of IaaS as a block of servers is permanently dedicated to one customer

     - "private cloud" has to be a cloud computing arrangement where the hardware concerned is owned and housed in a vendor's shared data centre

=> dedicated hosting

   + customer rents dedicated physical servers on demand from anywhere within a data centre

     - while this means that the hardware they use is mixed-in with that of other customers, 
       in this IaaS category once again customers do not share the particular servers they use with anybody else

     - less costly than a private cloud

     - can therefore be dynamically scaled

     - customer is able to increase or decrease the number of servers

     - paying for on a daily or even hourly basis

=> hybrid hosting

   + customer rents on demand a mix of dedicated physical servers and as well as some less expensive virtual server instances

     - a company may run all of its applications on dedicated physical servers, but store its data on virtual server instances

     - the whole offering is dynamically scalable

=> cloud hosting

   + customer rents as many or as few virtual server instances as they require on demand

     - customers share all of the servers they use with other customers

     - some companies subsequently see this as too risky

     - lowest-cost and by far the most technically and environmentally efficient form of IaaS

     - allows an IaaS provider to run all of their physical servers in use to capacity and to close down those not required

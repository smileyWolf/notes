=> The Three Reasons to Cloud Compute

   1. The Competitive Cloud

      - cloud computing will become essential for firms that wish to remain competitive

        + it will cost them less to cloud compute than to run an in-house data centre

        + because cloud computing is dynamically-scalable, task-centric and does not require substantial fixed-cost investments, 
          firms that cloud compute are also likely to be more competitively agile than their competitors

        + compares the growth of cloud computing to the development of the electricity network around a century ago
          businesses had to make their own power using internal generators;
          when a reliable electricity grid became available, companies were increasingly freed from having to generate their own energy in-house

        + two competitive benefits
          firstly, it saved companies money
          secondly, it allowed companies to focus their resources on other aspects of their business

        + ThinDesk is now offering small and medium-sized companies in Canada the opportunity to move to a thin client / cloud infrastructure

   2. The Green Cloud

      - it is more green

        + most internal company data centres run their servers at around thirty per cent capacity

        + large cloud data centre typically run at eighty per cent capacity or more

        + less energy is wasted, with the carbon footprint of each unit of computing power being reduced

      - more environmentally friendly than traditional computing

        + removes the need for most users to have high-power PCs and laptops

        + lower-power computers based around processors such as Intel's Atom are perfectly sufficient to run cloud applications

        + can also cut end-user energy bills and carbon footprints

      - cloud collaboration and virtual meeting tools may also allow some people to work from home a little more and to make fewer business trips

        + help to take some cars off the road and some planes out of the sky

   3. The Next Generation Cloud

      - cloud computing will be driven not only by a desire and necessity to do existing things in more effective ways, but by a demand to do entirely new things

      - one of the defining characteristics of cloud computing is that it enables value to created via collaboration and data sharing

        + we will be prevented from obtaining the benefits of new developments such as "crowdsouring" unless many of us cloud compute

      - Crowdsourcing

        + the rise of cloud computing will make it easier for individuals to consciously work together on crowdsourcing projects

      - Google Goggles visual search

        + allows items viewed by a smartphone camera to be identified and used as the basis for a web search

      - augmented reality

        + real-time cloud data is overlaid on the camera feed of a smartphone or other mobile device

        + users of the Layar augmented reality browser can now see other the photos and tweets of Twitter users in their area

      - data shadow

        + soon there will be so many cameras, microphones and other sensors online that a great many objects will start to cast a constant data shadow in the cloud

        + satellite navigation systems will be able to advise on routes based not only on internal maps, 
          but also the position and predicted intent of all other vehicles on the road

      - artificial intelligence

        + developments in artificial intelligence will also depend on crowdsourced cloud data

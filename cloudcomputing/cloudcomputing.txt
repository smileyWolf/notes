Summary
=======
=> Run apps, store data online with different level of flexibility and control
   1. SaaS; run existing apps (user.)
   2. PaaS; create own/new apps using vendor's environment and tools (developer.)
   3. IaaS; run any app on vendor's hardware (sysadmins.)

Definition
==========
Cloud computing is where software applications, processing power, data and potentially even artificial intelligence are accessed over the Internet.

Building Blocks (allow to run applications and store data online, each offers a different level of user flexibility and control)
===============
1. SaaS
   => Allows users to run existing online applications; off-the-shelf applications accessed over the Internet (pixlr, jaycut, aviary.)
   => Pros & Cons
      1. + Free/paid via subscription.
      2. + Accessible from any computer.
      3. + Facilitates collaborative working.
      4. - Generic applications not always suitable for business use.

2. PaaS
   => Allows users to create own cloud applications using supplier-specific tools and languages; 
      provides environment and tools for creating new online applications (google app engine, windows azure, salesforce force.com).
      Developers don't create VM directly, rather they provide an application to platform, which the platform then runs;
      "Here platform, here is my app, run my app."
   => Pros & Cons
      1. + Rapid development at low cost.
      2. + Private or public deployment.
      3. - Limits/constrains/restrictive developers to provider languages and tools.
      4. - Risk of vendor lock-in; cannot move code from one vendor to another.

3. IaaS
   => Allows users to run any applications on cloud hardware of own choice; allows existing applications to be run on a cloud supplier's hardware.
      Users create virtual machines (VMs) on demand from a library of pre-existing VM images (VM for DBMS, VM for WebServer, ...)
      Ex: computing applications run on platforms, platforms in turn run on computing infrastructure;
          Microsoft Word application runs on the Microsoft Windows platform, in turn the Microsoft Windows platform runs on the infrastructure of an IBM-compatible PC.
   => Server: Fundamental unit of cloud infrastructure
      1. Physical (real, dedicated): discrete individual computers
      2. Virtual (virtual server instance): software-controlled slices of physical server.
         Created by a process called virtualization that allows many users to share the processing power of one physical server.
         Seen cheaper, but less secure for those who do not want to share server hardware with other customers.
   => Types
      1. Private Cloud: specific number of physical servers dedicated to one customer.
      2. Dedicated Hosting: customer runs physical servers (not shared with others) on demand matching their requirements.
      3. Hybrid Hosting: mix of physical servers and virtual server instances reduce cost and increase flexibility.
      4. Cloud Hosting: customer rents virtual server instances on demand (Amazon Web Services AWS including EC2 and S3; 
         Rackspace with Rackspace Cloud Servers and Rackspace Cloud Files; GoGrid.)


Characteristics
===============
=> Cloud computing is:
   1. Dynamically scalable
   2. Device-independent
   3. Task centric
      Users focus on what they want to achieve, rather than any software, hardware or network infrastructure.
      No need to purchase or install anything before using cloud computing resource.
   4. Charged on usage basis

Reasons to cloud compute
========================
1. Remain competitive
2. Stay green
3. Next-generation applications

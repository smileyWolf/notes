Building Blocks (allow to run applications and store data online, each offers a different level of user flexibility and control)
===============
1. SAAS
   - Allows users to run existing online applications; off-the-shelf applications accessed over the Internet (pixlr, jaycut, aviary.)
   - Pros & Cons
     1. + Free/paid via subscription.
     2. + Accessible from any computer.
     3. + Facilitates collaborative working.
     4. - Generic applications not always suitable for business use.

2. PAAS
   - Allows users to create own cloud applications using supplier-specific tools and languages; 
     provides environment and tools for creating new online applications (google app engine, windows azure, salesforce force.com).
   - Pros & Cons
     1. + Rapid development at low cost.
     2. + Private or public deployment.
     3. - Limits developers to provider languages and tools.
     4. - Risk of vendor lock-in; cannot move code from one vendor to another.

3. IAAS
   - Allows users to run any applications on cloud hardware of own choice; allows existing applications to be run on a cloud supplier's hardware.
   - Servers: Fundamental unit of cloud infrastructure
     1. Physical: discrete individual computers
     2. Virtual (virtual server instance): software control slices of physical server but shared among many users 
        by a process called virtualization (allows many users to share one physical server.)
   - Types
     1. Private Cloud: specific number of physical servers dedicated to one customer.
     2. Dedicated Hosting: customer runs physical servers (not shared with others) on demand matching their requirements.
     3. Hybrid Hosting: mix of physical servers and virtual server instances reduce cost and increase flexibility.
     4. Cloud Hosting: customer rents virtual server instances on demand.

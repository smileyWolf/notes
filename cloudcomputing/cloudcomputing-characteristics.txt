=> Cloud Computing Characteristics

   + cloud computing is where dynamically scalable, device-independent and task-centric computing resources are provided online, 
     with all charges being on a usage basis

     - dynamically scalable because users only have to consume the amount of online computing resources they actually want

     - device-independent because cloud computing resources can be accessed not just from any computer on the Internet, but also any type of computer

     - task centric because the usage model is based entirely around what users want to achieve, 
       rather than any particular software, hardware or network infrastructure

     - charged on a usage basis, it has no fixed costs

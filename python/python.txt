=> Scripting with Windows PowerShell

   + About

     1. is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration

     2. built on the .NET Framework

     3. helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows OS and applications that run on Windows

     4. commands, called cmdlets

        - let you manage the computers from the command line

     5. providers

        - let you access data stores, such as the registry and certificate store

     6. rich expression parser

     7. a fully developed scripting language

   + Features

     1. cmdlets

        - performing common system administration tasks managing the registry, services, processes, and event logs, 
          and using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)

     2. a task-based scripting language and support for existing scripts and command-line tools

     3. Consistent design

        - because cmdlets and system data stores use common syntax and naming conventions, 
          data can be shared easily and the output from one cmdlet can be used as the input to another cmdlet without reformatting or manipulation

     4. simplified, command-based navigation of the operating system

        - lets users navigate the registry and other data stores by using the same techniques that they use to navigate the file system

     5. object manipulation capabilities

        - objects can be directly manipulated or sent to other tools or databases

     6. extensible interface

        independent software vendors and enterprise developers can build custom tools and utilities to administer their software

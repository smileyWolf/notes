=> Installing Python on Windows

   1. “Windows Installer” link from the home page of the Python.org web site

      + add the directories for your default Python version to the PATH

        - C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\

        - [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")

   2. setuptools + pip

      + packaging and installation facilities

        - setuptools for Windows: ez_setup.py (command available to you: easy_install) [https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py]

        - pip: get-pip.py (its replacement: pip) [https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py]

   3. virtual environments

      + a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them

        - it solves the “Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x” dilemma

        - you can work on a project which requires Django 1.3 while also maintaining a project which requires Django 1.0
